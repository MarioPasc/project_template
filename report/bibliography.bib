@article{Root2021,
	abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that are thought to exist on a clinical and pathological spectrum. FTD and ALS are linked by shared genetic causes (e.g. C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions) and neuropathology, such as inclusions of ubiquitinated, misfolded proteins (e.g. TAR DNA-binding protein 43; TDP-43) in the CNS. Furthermore, some genes that cause FTD or ALS when mutated encode proteins that localize to the lysosome or modulate endosome-lysosome function, including lysosomal fusion, cargo trafficking, lysosomal acidification, autophagy, or TFEB activity. In this review, we summarize evidence that lysosomal dysfunction, caused by genetic mutations (e.g. C9orf72, GRN, MAPT, TMEM106B) or toxic-gain of function (e.g. aggregation of TDP-43 or tau), is an important pathogenic disease mechanism in FTD and ALS. Further studies into the normal function of many of these proteins are required and will help uncover the mechanisms that cause lysosomal dysfunction in FTD and ALS. Mutations or polymorphisms in genes that encode proteins important for endosome-lysosome function also occur in other age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's (e.g. APOE, PSEN1, APP) and Parkinson's (e.g. GBA, LRRK2, ATP13A2) disease. A more complete understanding of the common and unique features of lysosome dysfunction across the spectrum of neurodegeneration will help guide the development of therapies for these devastating diseases.},

@article{Casterton2020,
	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) constitute aggressive neurodegenerative pathologies that lead to the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons and of neocortical areas, respectively. In the past decade, the identification of several genes that cause these disorders indicated that the two diseases overlap in a multifaceted spectrum of conditions. The autophagy-lysosome system has been identified as a main intersection for the onset and progression of neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD. Genetic evidence has revealed that several genes with a mechanistic role at different stages of the autophagy process are mutated in patients with ALS/FTD. Moreover, the three main proteins aggregating in ALS/FTD, including in sporadic cases, are also targeted by autophagy and affect this process. Here, we examine the varied dysfunctions and degrees of involvement of the autophagy-lysosome system that have been discovered in ALS/FTD. We argue that these findings shed light on the pathological mechanisms in the ALS/FTD spectrum and conclude that they have important consequences both for treatment options and for the basic biomolecular understanding of how this process intersects with RNA metabolism, the other major cellular process reported to be dysfunctional in part of the ALS/FTD spectrum.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitin-positive tau-negative neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and dystrophic neurites are common pathological features in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with or without symptoms of motor neuron disease and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses, we have identified a TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), a nuclear factor that functions in regulating transcription and alternative splicing, as a component of these structures in FTLD. Furthermore, skein-like inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions, and glial inclusions in the spinal cord of ALS patients are also positive for TDP-43. Dephosphorylation treatment of the sarkosyl insoluble fraction has shown that abnormal phosphorylation takes place in accumulated TDP-43. The common occurrence of intracellular accumulations of TDP-43 supports the hypothesis that these disorders represent a clinicopathological entity of a single disease, and suggests that they can be newly classified as a proteinopathy of TDP-43. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

%Carmen. ELA y DFT relación con C9orf72
@article{Balendra2018,
	abstract = {The discovery that repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are a frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has revolutionized our understanding of these diseases. Substantial headway has been made in characterizing C9orf72-mediated disease and unravelling its underlying aetiopathogenesis. Three main disease mechanisms have been proposed: loss of function of the C9orf72 protein and toxic gain of function from C9orf72 repeat RNA or from dipeptide repeat proteins produced by repeat-associated non-ATG translation. Several downstream processes across a range of cellular functions have also been implicated. In this article, we review the pathological and mechanistic features of C9orf72-associated FTD and ALS (collectively termed C9FTD/ALS), the model systems used to study these conditions, and the probable initiators of downstream disease mechanisms. We suggest that a combination of upstream mechanisms involving both loss and gain of function and downstream cellular pathways involving both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects contributes to disease progression. Repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are a frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Balendra and Isaacs review the pathological and mechanistic features of C9orf72-associated ALS and FTD, highlighting loss-of-function, gain-of-function and downstream mechanisms.},

Among the most prominent areas of progress is the overlap between FTD, MND, and other neurodegenerative conditions at a clinicopathologic and genetic level. In parallel major advances in neuroimaging techniques, the discovery of new genetic mutations as well as the development of potential biomarkers may serve to further expand knowledge of the biologic processes at play in FTD and may in turn propel research toward identifying curative and preventative pharmacologic therapies. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the clinical, pathologic, and genetic complexities of FTD and related disorders.},

Motor neuron disease develops in a proportion of patients with frontotemporal dementia, but the incidence, severity and functional significance of motor system dysfunction in patients with frontotemporal dementia has not been determined. Neurophysiological biomarkers have been developed to document motor system dysfunction including: short-interval intracortical inhibition, a marker of corticospinal motor neuron dysfunction and the neurophysiological index, a marker of lower motor neuron dysfunction. The present study performed detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments on 108 participants including 40 consecutive patients with frontotemporal dementia, 42 age- and gender-matched patients with motor neuron disease and 26 control subjects. Of the 40 patients with frontotemporal dementia, 12.5\% had concomitant motor neuron disease. A further 27.3\% of the patients with frontotemporal dementia had clinical evidence of minor motor system dysfunction such as occasional fasciculations, mild wasting or weakness. Biomarkers of motor system function were abnormal in frontotemporal dementia. Average short-interval intracortical inhibition was reduced in frontotemporal dementia (4.3 ± 1.7\%) compared with controls (9.1 ± 1.1\%, P \\&lt; 0.05). Short-interval intracortical inhibition was particularly reduced in the progressive non-fluent aphasia subgroup, but was normal in patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia. The neurophysiological index was reduced in frontotemporal dementia (1.1) compared with controls (1.9, P \\&lt; 0.001), indicating a degree of lower motor neuron dysfunction, although remained relatively preserved when compared with motor neuron disease (0.7, P \\&lt; 0.05). Motor system dysfunction in frontotemporal dementia may result from pathological involvement of the primary motor cortex, with secondary degeneration of lower motor neurons in the brainstem and anterior horn of the spinal cord.}",

@article{Bussi2018,
	abstract = {Autophagic dysfunction and protein aggregation have been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, but the exact mechanisms and causal connections are not clear and most previous work was done in neurons and not in microglial cells. Here, we report that exogenous fibrillary, but not monomeric, alpha-synuclein (AS, also known as SNCA) induces autophagy in microglial cells. We extensively studied the dynamics of this response using both live-cell imaging and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), and found that it correlates with lysosomal damage and is characterised by the recruitment of the selective autophagy-associated proteins TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and optineurin (OPTN) to ubiquitylated lysosomes. In addition, we observed that LC3 (MAP1LC3B) recruitment to damaged lysosomes was dependent on TBK1 activity. In these fibrillar AS-treated cells, autophagy inhibition impairs mitochondrial function and leads to microglial cell death. Our results suggest that microglial autophagy is induced in response to lysosomal damage caused by persistent accumulation of AS fibrils. Importantly, triggering of the autophagic response appears to be an attempt at lysosomal quality control and not for engulfment of fibrillar AS.},
