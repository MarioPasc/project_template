class FunctionalAnalysis:
    """
    The FunctionalAnalysis class provides methods for performing functional enrichment analysis on gene clusters.

    This class uses a graph structure (igraph.Graph) to store clusters and genes as nodes and integrates with the Enrichr 
    service for enrichment analysis. It supports saving the analysis results to a CSV file and filtering the results based 
    on various criteria such as adjusted p-value, Combined Score, or overlap percentage.

    Key Features:
    - Perform functional enrichment analysis for clusters defined in a JSON structure.
    - Save enrichment analysis results to a specified CSV file.
    - Filter enrichment results based on adjusted p-value, Combined Score, or overlap percentage.
    - Verbose logging support for detailed execution tracking.

    Methods:
    - __init__(graph): Initializes the class with a graph containing the clusters.
    - perform_analysis(clustering_data, output_file, algorithm): Performs enrichment analysis on clusters and saves results.
    - filter_results(input_file, output_file, p_value_threshold, combined_score_min, overlap_percentage_min): Filters and saves results.
